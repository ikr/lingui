# Overview

Lingui _(по-русски -- лингуй)_ is an attempt to rethink the administrative graphical user interfaces
for software applications, replacing the massive data grids, tree views, tab views, and monster
forms with a simple, application-specific, human-computer interaction _language._ Lingui is intended
to provide software libraries, a domain-specific metalanguage, and a general guidance for
constructing the language-centric user interfaces.

How does it work? Well, you just type what you want, and -- BOOM -- it happens. OK-OK, that's not
quite the whole story. You have to know what to type: which commands are possible in the current
_context_, what arguments are acceptable for those commands. Essentially, you have to speak the
application's language. You may say "whoa, that sounds like quite a learning curve to climb!" Not at
all. The system will help you _a lot,_ providing automatic typeahead-style suggestions and
previews. It also learns your usage patterns, and short-circuits the most common actions for you.
