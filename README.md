# Overview

Lingui _(по-русски -- лингуй)_ is an attempt to rethink the administrative graphical user interfaces
for software applications, replacing the massive data grids, tree views, tab views, and monster
forms with a simple, application-specific, human-computer interaction _language._ Lingui is intended
to provide software libraries, a domain-specific metalanguage, and a general guidance for
constructing the language-centric user interfaces.
